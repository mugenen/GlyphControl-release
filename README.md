## :high_brightness: Highlights

* We propose a glyph-conditional text-to-image generation model named **GlyphControl** for visual text generation, which outperforms DeepFloyd IF and Stable Diffusion in terms of OCR accuracy and CLIP score while saving the number of parameters by more than 3×.

* We introduce a visual text generation benchmark named **LAION-Glyph** by filtering the LAION-2B-en and selecting the images with rich visual text content by using the modern OCR system. We conduct experiments on three different dataset scales: LAION-Glyph-100K,LAION-Glyph-1M, and LAION-Glyph-10M.

* We report **flexible** and **customized** visual text generation results. We empirically show that the users can control the content, locations, and sizes of generated visual text through the interface of glyph instructions.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Test Benchmark

* **SimpleBench**: A simple text prompt benchmark following the [Character-aware Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10562). The format of prompts remains the same:  _`A sign that says "\<word>".'_
* **CreativeBench**: A creative text prompt benchmark adapted from [GlyphDraw](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17870). We adopt diverse English-version prompts in the original benchmark and replace the words inside quotes. As an example, the prompt may look like: _`Little panda holding a sign that says "\<word>".'_ or _'A photographer wears a t-shirt with the word "\<word>." printed on it.'_

(The prompts are listed in the ```text_prompts``` folder)

Following [Character-aware Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10562), we collect a pool of single-word candidates from Wikipedia. These words are
then categorized into **four** buckets based on their frequencies: top 1K, 1k to 10k, 10k to 100k, and 100k plus. Each bucket contains words with frequencies in the respective range. To form input
prompts, we randomly select **100** words from each bucket and insert them into the above
templates. We generate **four** images for each word during the evaluation process.

## :camera: Quantitative Results

We evaluate the OCR accuracy through three metrics, i.e., exact match accuracy $\bf{Acc}$, capitalization-insensitive exact match accuracy $\bf{\hat{Acc}}$, average Levenshtein distance $\bf{LD}$. Besids, we also assess the image-text alignment through **CLIP score**.

Method | #Params |Training Dataset  | $\bf{Acc}$ (%) $\uparrow$ | $\bf{\hat{Acc}}$ (%) $\uparrow$ |$\bf{LD}\downarrow$ | CLIP Score $\uparrow$ 
:--------- | :--------- | :--------| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
Stable Diffusion v2.0 | 865M | LAION 1.2B  | $0/0$ | $3/2$ | $4.25/5.01$  | $31.6/33.8$ 
DeepFloyd (IF-I-M) | 2.1B | LAION 1.2B  | $0.3/0.1$ | $18/11$ |  $2.44/3.86$ | $32.8/34.3$  
DeepFloyd (IF-I-L)  | 2.6B | LAION 1.2B  | $0.3/0.7$ | $26/17$ |  $1.97/3.37$ | $33.1/34.9$ 
DeepFloyd (IF-I-XL)  | 6.0B | LAION 1.2B  | $0.6/1$ | $33/21$  | $1.63/3.09$ | $33.5/35.2$
GlyphControl | 1.3B | LAION-Glyph-100K  | $30/19$  |  $37/24$ | $1.77/2.58$ | $33.7/36.2$
GlyphControl | 1.3B |  LAION-Glyph-1M  | $40/26$ |  $45/30$ | $1.59/2.47$ | $33.4/36.0$ 
GlyphControl| 1.3B | LAION-Glyph-10M  | $\bf{42}/\bf{28}$ |  $\bf{48}/\bf{34}$ | $\bf{1.43}/\bf{2.40}$ | $\bf{33.9}/\bf{36.2}$

The results shown here are averaged over four word-frequency buckets. The results on **SimpleBench** / **CreativeBench** are presented on the left/right side of the slash, respectively.


## :wrench: Installation
Clone this repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/AIGText/GlyphControl-release.git
cd GlyphControl-release
```

Install required Python packages
```
conda create -n GlyphControl python=3.9
conda activate GlyphControl
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or

conda env create -f environment_simple.yaml
conda activate GlyphControl
```

Althoguh you could run our codes on CPU device,  we recommend you to use CUDA device for faster inference. The recommended CUDA setting is **CUDA 11.3**.


## :unlock: Available Checkpoints

Download the checkpoints from our [hugging face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIGText/GlyphControl/tree/main/checkpoints) and put the corresponding checkpoint files into the ```checkpoints``` folder. 
We provide **four** types of checkpoints. 

Apart from the model trained on **LAION-Glyph-10M** for 6 epochs,  we also fine-tune the model for additional 40 epochs on **TextCaps-5K**, a subset of [TextCaps v0.1 Dataset](https://textvqa.org/textcaps/dataset/) consisting of 5K images related to signs, books, and posters.During the fine-tuning, we also train the U-Net decoder of the original SD branch according to the ablation study in our [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18259).

The relevant information is shown below. 

Checkpoint File | Training Dataset  | Trainig Epochs| $\bf{Acc}$ (%) $\uparrow$ | $\bf{\hat{Acc}}$ (%) $\uparrow$ |$\bf{LD}\downarrow$ | CLIP Score $\uparrow$ 
:--------- | :--------- | :--------:| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
laion10M_epoch_6_model_wo_ema.ckpt | LAION-Glyph-10M  | 6 | $\bf{42}/\bf{28}$ |  $\bf{48}/\bf{34}$ | $\bf{1.43}/\bf{2.40}$ | $\bf{33.9}/\bf{36.2}$ | 
textcaps5K_epoch_10_model_wo_ema.ckpt | TextCaps 5K  | 10 | $58/30$  | $64/34$ | $1.01/2.40$ | $33.8/35.1$
textcaps5K_epoch_20_model_wo_ema.ckpt | TextCaps 5K  | 20 | $57/32$  | $66/38$ | $0.97/2.26$ | $34.2/35.5$
textcaps5K_epoch_40_model_wo_ema.ckpt | TextCaps 5K  | 40 | $\bf{71}/\bf{41}$ |  $\bf{77}/\bf{46}$ | $\bf{0.55}/\bf{1.67}$ | $\bf{34.2}/\bf{35.8}$ | 

Although the models fine-tuned on TextCaps 5K demonstrate high OCR accuracy, the creativity and diversity of generted images may be lost. Feel free to try all the provided checkpoints for comparison. 

## :mag_right: Glyph Instructions

* **Text character information**: GlyphControl allows for the specification of not only single words but also phrases or sentences composed of multiple words. As long as the text is intended to **be placed within the same area**, users can customize the text accordingly.

* **Text line information**: GlyphControl provides the flexibility to assign words to multiple lines by adjusting the **number of rows**. This feature enhances the visual effects and allows for more versatile text arrangements.

* **Text box information**: Users have control over the font size of the rendered text by modifying the **width** property of the text bounding box. The location of the text on the image can be specified using the **coordinates** of the top left corner. Additionally, the **yaw rotation angle** of the text box allows for further adjustments. By default, the text is rendered following the optimal width-height ratio, but users can define a specific width-height ratio to precisely control the height of the text box (not recommended).

Users should provide the above three types of glyph instructions for inference. 


## :wrench: Inference
To run inference code locally, you need specify the glyph instructions first in the file ```glyph_instructions.yaml```.

And then execute the code like this:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/config.yaml --ckpt checkpoints/laion10M_epoch_6_model_wo_ema.ckpt --save_path generated_images --glyph_instructions glyph_instructions.yaml --prompt <Prompt> --num_samples 4
```

If you do not want to generate visual text, you could remove the "--glyph_instructions" parameter in the command.


## :open_hands: Demo (Recommend)
As an easier way to conduct trials on our models, you could test through a demo.

After downloading the checkpoints, execute the code:
```
python app.py
```
Then you could generate visual text through a local demo interface. 

Or you can directly try our **demo** in our **hugging face** space [GlyphControl](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIGText/GlyphControl).

In the current version of our demo, we support four groups of ```Render Text``` at most.  Users should enter in the glyph instructions at corresponding parts.

## :question: Q&A
Q: What is the approximate success rate?

A: About 10-20%. Since the current version is an alpha version, the success rate is relatively low.
